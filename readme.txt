Integrates your WordPress site with Kissmetrics to track meaningful user data, with or without Paid Memberships Pro.

= Official Paid Memberships Pro Add On =

This is an official Add On for [Paid Memberships Pro](https://www.paidmembershipspro.com), the most complete member management and membership subscriptions plugin for WordPress.

= Default WordPress Tracking =
Kissmetrics allows you to track meaningful data on per user level, giving you a clear picture of what your visitors are really doing on your website - this plugin works with or without [Paid Memberships Pro](https://www.paidmembershipspro.com). Events and properties tracked by default include:

* Events: user registration, user login
* Properties: username, email address, display name, user ID

= Paid Memberships Pro Tracking =
The Kissmetrics Add On for Paid Memberships Pro takes this a step further, allowing you to identify users by their WordPress username, email address, or display name, and track specific events and properties, including:

= Tracked Events in Paid Memberships Pro =
* user visits any front end PMPro page (Levels, Account, Billing, Checkout, etc.). When a user visits the Checkout page, the selected level will be included as well.
* user changes membership level
* user checks out for any level
* user cancels level
* user starts trial – this occurs when there is a trial set for the level on the Edit Membership Level page

= Tracked Properties in Paid Memberships Pro =
* membership level
* last order ID
* last checkout total

Kissmetrics attaches these properties to Customers, giving you all sorts of meaningful data to create different metrics and reports, giving you exactly the information you need to make important decisions and increase your business.

Each event can be enabled or disabled on the PMPro Kissmetrics Settings page under Settings > PMPro Kissmetrics.
